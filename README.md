# Week-Two-Assignment

Reflection

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
I was able to achieve achieve the basic requirements which are:

1. Implement responsive design methods to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).
2. Implement at least one meaningful media query so that there is a noticeable change between mobile and desktop view (an example is to change where the ‘thumbnail bar’ is positioned).
3. Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.
4. Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

I could not complete the stretch requirement which are:

1. Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
2. Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.
3. Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Optional

I would not say they were particularly difficult. My take is that I have not fully grasped the principles/skills in the requested topics. And I wasted alot of time trying to make the basic requirements work. Hence the reason why I could not find time to fully revise what was required in the stretch requirement.

🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

1. I watched a few videos on Youtube just to get a reminder of responsive designs.

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

1. Trying to fit the large image to fill the page was a struggle.
2. Getting the border on the thumbnail container was not easy. It made the page not to be inviting. When it finally showed I felt good.

What went really well and what could have gone better?

1. What went well: Getting the small images into the thumbnail and also making them show as large images
2. What could have gone better: My coding time. I had finished writing my code before i realised I needed an image slider/pointer. Hence I had to start a contingent plan. It happened in the end but I feel I may have gone the long way to produce what could have been done in a shorter way.

I am however thankful for the ability to be able to attempt the assignment.
